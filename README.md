# win10script
This is the Ultimate Windows 10 Script from a creation from multiple debloat scripts and gists from github.

Open a CMD as Administrator and run this:
```
powershell -nop -c "iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Levi990e/win10script/master/win10debloat.ps1')"
```
If you dont want to install any programs, just debloat then run this instead:
```
powershell -nop -c "iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Levi990e/win10script/master/win10debloat2.ps1')"
```

- One Command to launch and run
- Chocolatey Install
- O&O Shutup10 CFG and Run
- Added Install Programs
- Added Debloat Microsoft Store Apps
- Installs Notepad++, VLC, 7-Zip, Avast, Firefox
- Disables One Drive
- etc. that I need to list

Credit goes to Disassembler, creator of the script and Chris Titus who made some changes to it.
I only made some small changes to my likings.
